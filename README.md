A python code that calculates the distance from the ISS to earth and calculates itÂ´s velocity
By simplifying the Newton's law of universal gravitation and equate it to Newton's second law (F=ma) to calculate the satelite's distace to earth.
And with the information calculate it's velocity.
All the math and physics are available in the physics file
